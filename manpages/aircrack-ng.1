.TH AIRCRACK-NG 1 "September 2006" "Version 0.6.2"

.SH NAME
.B aircrack-ng
is a 802.11 WEP / WPA-PSK key cracker.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aircrack-ng
[options] <.cap / .ivs file(s)>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI aircrack-ng
is a 802.11 WEP / WPA-PSK key cracker. It implements the so-called Fluhrer - Mantin - Shamir (FMS) attack, along with some new attacks by a talented hacker named KoreK. When enough encrypted packets have been gathered, aircrack-ng can almost instantly recover the WEP key.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.B Common options:
.TP
.I -a <amode>
Force the attack mode, 1 or wep for WEP and 2 or wpa for WPA-PSK.
.TP
.I -e <essid>
Select the target network based on the ESSID. This option is also required for WPA cracking if the SSID is cloacked.
.TP
.I -b <bssid>
Select the target network based on the access point's MAC address.
.TP
.I -p <nbcpu>
Set this option to the number of CPUs to use (only available on SMP systems). By default, it uses all available CPUs
.TP
.I -q
If set, no status information is displayed.
.PP
.TP
.B Static WEP cracking options:
.TP
.I -c
Search alpha-numeric characters only.
.TP
.I -t
Search binary coded decimal characters only.
.TP
.I -h 
Search the numeric key for Fritz!BOX
.TP
.I -d <mask>
Specify mask of the key. For example: A1:XX:CF
.TP
.I -m <maddr>
Only keep the IVs coming from packets that match this MAC address. Alternatively, use \-m ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff to use all and every IVs, regardless of the network (this disables ESSID and BSSID filtering).
.TP
.I -n <nbits>
Specify the length of the key: 64 for 40-bit WEP, 128 for 104-bit WEP, etc., until 512 bits of length. The default value is 128.
.TP
.I -i <index>
Only keep the IVs that have this key index (1 to 4). The default behaviour is to ignore the key index in the packet, and use the IV regardless.
.TP
.I -f <fudge>
By default, this parameter is set to 2. Use a higher value to increase the bruteforce level: cracking will take more time, but with a higher likelihood of success.
.TP
.I -k <korek>
There are 17 KoreK attacks. Sometimes one attack creates a huge false positive that prevents the key from being found, even with lots of IVs. Try \-k 1, \-k 2, ... \-k 17 to disable each attack selectively.
.TP
.I -x or -x0
Disable last keybytes bruteforce (not advised).
.TP
.I -x1
Enable last keybyte bruteforcing (default)
.TP
.I -x2
Enable last two keybytes bruteforcing.
.TP
.I -X
Disable bruteforce multithreading (SMP only).
.TP
.I -s
Shows ASCII version of the key at the right of the screen
.TP
.I -y  
This is an experimental single brute-force attack which should only be used when the standard attack mode fails with more than one million IVs.
.PP
.TP
.B WPA-PSK cracking options:
.TP
.I -w <words>
Path to a dictionary file for wpa cracking. Specify "-" to use stdin.
