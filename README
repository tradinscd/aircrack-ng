Installing
==========

This version now require more libraries than 0.X versions to be compiled. 
See INSTALLING file for more information

OpenWrt Devices
===============

You can use airodump-ng on OpenWrt devices. You'll have to use specify
prism0 as interface. Airodump-ng will automatically create it.
Rq: Aireplay DOESN'T work on OpenWrt with broadcom chipset since the driver doesn't support injection


Known bugs:
===========


Madwifi-ng known bugs:
----------------------

Problem: When changing rate while you are capturing packet makes airodump-ng stall
Solution: Restart airodump-ng or change rate before starting it

Problem: After some time it stops capturing packets and you're really sure no network manager are running at all.
Solution: That's a known bug in the driver, it may happen at any time
          (the time before it fails can vary a lot: from 5 minutes to 50 or even more).

Problem: When creating a new VAP airodump-ng takes up to 10-15 seconds to see the first packet
Solution: It's the behaviour of madwifi-ng, don't worry.

Orinoco bugs
------------

Problem: BSSID is not reported correctly or is 00:00:00:00:00:00 or signal is not reported correctly.
Solution: These are known bugs and we'll work on it.

Airolib-ng bugs:
----------------

On windows only, opening/creating a database doesn't work when airolib-ng is in directories containing
special characters like 'ç', 'é', 'è', 'à', ... (directories containing spaces are not affected).


Other issue:
------------

Problem: Airodump-ng stop working after some time
Solution: You may have a network manager running that puts back the card in managed mode. 
          You'll have to disable it (the fastest solution is killing the process) then restart airodump-ng.

    It show a connexion (authentication then association) to a WEP network (open authentication).

wep.shared.key.authentication.cap:
    It shows a connexion (authentication then association to a WEP network (shared authentication).
    The difference with open authentication is that the client has to encrypt a challenge text
    and send it back (encrypted) to the AP to prove it has the right key.

wpa.cap:
    This is a sample file with a WPA handshake. It is located in the test/ directory of the install files. 
    The passphrase is 'biscotte'. Use the password file (password.lst) which is in the same directory.

wpa2.eapol.cap: 
    This is a sample file with a WPA2 handshake. 
    It is located in the test/ directory of the install files. 
    The passphrase is '12345678'. Use the password file (password.lst) which is in the same directory.

test.ivs (http://download.aircrack-ng.org/wiki-files/other/test.ivs): 
    This is a 128 bit WEP key file.
    The key is AE:5B:7F:3A:03:D0:AF:9B:F6:8D:A5:E2:C7.

ptw.cap (http://dl.aircrack-ng.org/ptw.cap):
