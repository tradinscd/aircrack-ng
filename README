Airpcap
-------

Latest driver (3.2.1) is required.

The Aircrack-ng suite provided has been modified to work in conjunction with the AirPcap 
adapters and the drivers included in the AirPcap CD.

aireplay-ng requires an AirPcap Tx adapter to be able to function while all the other tools can use either adapter.


	Usage Instructions
	------------------

	The adapter name you need to use is \\.\airpcapXX, where XX is the number of the AirPcap device.
	For example:

	airodump-ng.exe \\.\airpcap00 airpcap 0 trace
	or
	aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -e "MYSSID" -a 11:22:33:44:55:66 -h 66:55:44:33:22:11 \\.\airpcap00


	How to build the sources Instructions
	-------------------------------------

	1. Install cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/
	2. Download the AirPcap Develper's pack from http://www.cacetech.com/support/downloads.htm
	3. Unpack the AirPcap Develper's pack inside the main aircrack folder, and rename the new directory to "AirPcap_Devpack"
	4. Open a bash shell
	5. run "make -f Makefile.airpcap"

OpenWrt Devices
---------------

You can use airodump-ng on OpenWrt devices. You'll have to use specify
prism0 as interface. Airodump-ng will automatically create it.
Rq: Aireplay DOESN'T work on OpenWrt with broadcom chipset since the driver doesn't support injection


Other issue:
------------

Problem: Airodump-ng stop working after some time
Solution: You may have a network manager running that puts back the card in managed mode. 
          You'll have to disable it (the fastest solution is killing the process) then restart airodump-ng.


Madwifi-ng known bugs:
----------------------

Problem: When changing rate while you are capturing packet makes airodump-ng stall
Solution: Restart airodump-ng or change rate before starting it

Problem: After some time it stops capturing packets and you're really sure no network manager are running at all.
Solution: That's a known bug in the driver, it may happen at any time
          (the time before it fails can vary a lot: from 5 minutes to 50 or even more).

Problem: When creating a new VAP airodump-ng takes up to 10-15 seconds to see the first packet
Solution: It's the behaviour of madwifi-ng, don't worry.

	
Sample files
------------

wep.open.system.authentication.cap:
    It show a connexion (authentication then association) to a WEP network (open authentication).

wep.shared.key.authentication.cap:
    It shows a connexion (authentication then association to a WEP network (shared authentication).
    The difference with open authentication is that the client has to encrypt a challenge text
    and send it back (encrypted) to the AP to prove it has the right key.
    
wpa.cap:
    This is a sample file with a WPA handshake. It is located in the test/ directory of the install files. 
    The passphrase is 'biscotte'. Use the password file (password.lst) which is in the same directory.

wpa2.eapol.cap: 
    This is a sample file with a WPA2 handshake. 
    It is located in the test/ directory of the install files. 
    The passphrase is '12345678'. Use the password file (password.lst) which is in the same directory.

test.ivs (http://download.aircrack-ng.org/wiki-files/other/test.ivs): 
    This is a 128 bit WEP key file.
    The key is AE:5B:7F:3A:03:D0:AF:9B:F6:8D:A5:E2:C7.

ptw.cap (http://dl.aircrack-ng.org/ptw.cap): 
    This is a 64 bit WEP key file suitable for the PTW method (-z option).
    The key is '1F:1F:1F:1F:1F'.
